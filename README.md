# SPAM-Domains
Annoying sales spam sent from these email domains.

### How does a domain end up on this list?
There are various mailboxes that are monitored. When someone sends unsolicited emails and sends reminders again within a short time from a sales perspective, the email domain is included in the list.

### My domain name is on the list, how do I get off this list?
Good question... Uhm... Next question please :-)

### Why are you publishing this list?
The sales strategy chosen by sending multiple unsolicited emails is irritating and undesirable. To help organizations proactively prevent spam emails according to such sales strategies, this list is publicly accessible.

### How often is this list updated?
This list is maintained by volunteers, no agreements have been made as to how often domains will be added to the list. Typically, a domain is added within a few days of receiving a spam email in one of the monitored mailboxes.


## How can I block these spamming domains in Exchange Online?
The PowerShell script **blockSpamDomains.ps1** can be used for this. It will automatically download the latest list from this GitHub Repository.
